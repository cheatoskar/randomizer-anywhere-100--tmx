# For every server instance that exists on the machine (TMNF, and TMUF once it is set up) it:
#   - uploads RandomizerAnywhere.dll/.pdb to /tmp first (nothing is changed yet)
#   - waits until THAT instance has had no players for 2 minutes in a row
#   - re-checks the player count right before touching anything
#   - backs up the current files, swaps them in, restarts that instance's service
#   - checks that it came back healthy, and puts the old files back if it did not
# An instance whose service is not running (e.g. TMUF before its login is filled in) just gets the
# new files, with no restart. Instances are independent: the TMNF server never waits for TMUF.
